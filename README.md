# TechClub Website

## Overview

The TechClub Website project is dedicated to creating an online platform for the Computer Technology Club (CTC) at our university. This website serves as a hub for all things related to technology, including showcasing new technology trends, sharing tech news, facilitating knowledge exchange, and managing club projects that benefit students and universities.

## Model Selection

In this project, we have chosen to use the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This technology stack suits the needs of the TechClub Website by providing a robust and flexible environment for web development.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up the TechClub Website project on your local machine using the MERN stack.

## MongoDB Installation

1. Install MongoDB on your system.
2. Set up the MongoDB connection string and ensure it's properly configured.

## Express Installation

1. Navigate to the backend directory.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure environment variables by creating a `.env` file.
4. Start the backend server with `npm start`.

## React Installation

1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Install the frontend dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the frontend development server with `npm start`.

# Usage

You can now access and use the TechClub Website by opening it in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Explore the website and take advantage of its features.

# Deployment

To deploy this application in a production environment, follow the deployment guidelines of your chosen hosting platform.

Remember, the TechClub Website requires both the MongoDB database and the MERN stack servers to work, so ensure that all dependencies are installed and both the backend and frontend servers are up and running.

Feel free to modify and adapt this README to suit your specific project and documentation needs. Enjoy working on the TechClub Website!
